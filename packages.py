# Organise related modules inside packages

# two ways to import functions from another module
# import package.file
# package.file.function()

# from package.file import function
# can now call shorter:
# function

# if you want to import multiple functions, can either do that by doing them individualls like
# directly above (separating with commas)

# or all from file by
# from package import file
# file.function()
